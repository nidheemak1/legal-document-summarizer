It was an omnipresent case (as the \nsame issue was judged in the previous cases as well) and yet, it was distinct. The events of \nthe case, the socio -political d ebates which erupted after the verdict and the publicity that \nit received altered the communal climate in India. This judgment marks the inception of \nredressing regressive religious fundamentalist thinking with the instruments of \nconstitutionalism . \n \nI. INTROD UCTION \nIndia is a largest democratic country which rests its foundation on the ideals of equality. \nAccordingly, there persists uniform set of laws in constitution that binds all citizens, \nirrespective of religion, race, caste, sex and place of birth. However, in respect of matters \ninvolving family issues \u2013 marriage, divorce, maintenance and succession - there exists distinct \npersonal laws as per different faiths.  \nDuring 1970s and \u201980s, there were widespread conflicts as to the application of Indian laws  \non the personal affairs of the citizens who were governed by their own distinct personal laws. \nOne such area of conflict, was the applicability of Sec 125 of the Code of Criminal \nProcedure, 1973 (CrPC) on citizens of Islamic faith. As specified by this se ction, a \u2018First \nClass Magistrate could order a husband to provide a monthly allowance to his wife/divorced \nwife (as long as she had not remarried) if he neglected to maintain her and she was unable to \nmaintain herself\u2019. The primary objective of law was to ensure the emancipation of women \nwho were economically dependent on their husbands; it was a benign provision enacted to \nameliorate the economic condition of neglected wives and discarded divorcees\u20192. \nIn Islam, at the time of marriage the bride is entitled  to a \u2018marriage gift\u2019 which is known as \n                                                      \n \n1Author is a student at Vivekananda Institute Of Professional Studies, India.  \n2Bai Tahira v.

International Journal of Legal Science and Innovation    [ISSN 2581 -9453] Mahr . This can be paid either promptly or deferred to a later date (death of husband or at the \ntime of divorce). The Supreme Court encountered this issue in two cases3 : Can the payment \nof mahr (irrespective of its a mount) exonerate the liability of muslim husband under section \n125 of the CrPC? In both cases, the court gave a very liberal view and observed that payment \nof mahr will not fetter the woman\u2019s entitlement to maintenance under section 125 CrPC. \nThough signif icant, these decisions were inconspicuous and did not receive much coverage \ntill the Shah Bano case emerged.  \nII. FACTS  \nIn 1932, Mohammad Ahmed Khan a prosperous muslim lawyer4 got married with Shah Bano \nand the mahr that was fixed was Rs 3000. Out of this wedlock three sons and two daughters \nwere born. Subsequently, in 1978 he unilaterally divorced his forty -year-old wife by \npronouncing \u2018triple talaq\u2019 ( talaq -ul- biddat )5. Consequently, as per the provisions of Islamic \nLaw he paid the agreed  mahr to his div orced wife during iddat6. Having been thrashed out of \nher matrimonial home in Madhya Pradesh, she filed a petition under section 125 of the CrPC \nbefore Judicial Magistrate in Indore asking for a maintenance. The magistrate ordered the \nhusband to pay Shah B ano a meagre Rs 25 per month as maintenance. Dissatisfied with the \namount, she appealed to the Madhya Pradesh High Court in 1979, accordingly maintenance \namount was increased to Rs 179.20 per month. It was then that Shah Bano\u2019s ex -husband \npetitioned the Su preme Court in 1981 to challenge the high court\u2019s decision. He vehemently \ncontended that as per the provisions of Muslim personal law, a husband\u2019s liability to maintain \nhis wife after divorce extends only up to the iddat  period, therefore provisions of Sec 125 \nCrPC stands overruled.  \nThough, the concerned question of law was already discussed by Supreme Court in its \nprevious judgements7. However, when the matter came up before two judge bench of the \ncourt judges were of o pinion that the present judgements are not vigorous and had not been \naccurately pronounced. Therefore, in order to decide the issue involved, a five -judge \nConstitution Bench comprising of Chief Justice Y.V. Chandrachud, Justices D.A. Desai, E.S. \n                                                      \n \n3Ibid.; Fuzlunbi v. K.

International Journal of Legal Science and Innovation    [ISSN 2581 -9453] Venkataram iah, Ranganath Misra and O. Chinnappa Reddy was constituted.  \nIII. ISSUES  \nThe Supreme Court articulately framed the agonizing issues before it:  \n\uf0b7 Is Sec 125 of CrPC a secular provision?  \n\uf0b7 Is there any provision in the Muslim Personal Law under which a sum is payab le to \nthe wife \u2018on divorce\u20198? \n\uf0b7 Is the law so ruthless in its equality that, no matter how much the husband pays for the \nmaintenance of his divorced wife during the period of iddat  absolves him forever \nfrom the duty of paying adequately so as to enable her t o keep her body and soul \ntogether9? \nIV. REASONING  \nThe constitution bench unanimously mentioned en passant that Sec 125 of CrPC is a \nreligious neutral provision, whether the spouses were Hindus or Muslims, Christians or \nParsis, pagans or heathens is wholly irr elevant10. Its interpretation is that the concerned \nprovision is applicable to all persons belonging to all religions and has no relationship with \npersonal law of the parties11. It intends to serve a social purpose12.Therefore, it can be \ndeduced that underlying purpose of Sec 125 was to protect dependents from \u2018vagrancy\u2019 and \n\u2018destitution\u2019 \u2013 thus it saw no reason to exclude Muslims from its ambit.  \nThe court while drawing a line of demarcation between provisions of muslim law and Sec \n125 of CrPC was of c oncerned opinion that muslim personal law did not address the situation \nincorporated in Sec 125. The personal law allows payment of mahr during iddat but fails to \ncontemplate the situation where divorced wife is not in a condition to maintain herself after  \nthe expiration of iddat.  Thus, using \u2018deft interpretative tools\u2019 the court reconciled muslim \npersonal law and Sec 125. Therefore, court stated in existence of perceived conflict between \nthe two, the CrPC would override the provisions of muslim personal la w.  \nThe court while rejecting the argument that the order for maintenance under Sec 125 could be \ncancelled under Sec 127, simply because the husband had made a payment ( mahr in this \ncase) to the wife at the time of divorce, under muslim personal law, assid uously stated that \n                                                      \n \n8Supra note 1, para 7  \n9Supra note 1, para 3  \n10Ibid \n11Nanak Chand v. Shri Chandra Kishore Agarwal, AIR 1970 SC 446  \n12Jagir Kaur v. Jaswant Singh, AIR 1963 SC 1521  \n457 International Journal of Legal Science and Innovation  [Vol. 2 Iss 1; 454] \n \n\u00a9 2020. International Journal of Legal Science and Innovation    [ISSN 2581 -9453] mahr is not a payment liable to be paid at the time of divorce. While acknowledging the \ninterpretation of expression mahr, court came to the understanding that \u2013 it was an amount \nthat a wife is entitled to in consideration of marriage13, therefore cannot be considered as \ndivorce payment. The mere fact that mahr  was paid at the time of dissolution did not imply \nthat the payment was \u2018occasioned by divorce\u2019. Thus, defining mahr as a marriage \npayment14rather than divorce payment, the court emph asized that payment of mahr could not \nrestrain courts from awarding maintenance.  \nV. DISPOSITION  \nThe concordant opinions of five judge bench were: Firstly, Sec 125 of CrPC is a secular \nprovision which is applicable to all citizens irrespective of their religi on. Secondly, a \ndivorced muslim woman who is not able to maintain herself is entitled to claim compensation \nunder sec 125 of CrPC till she gets remarried. Lastly, if divorced muslim woman is able to \nmaintain herself then she is entitled to maintenance up t o the period of iddat. Accordingly, \nthe court unanimously reiterated the amount of compensation fixed by Madhya Pradesh High \nCourt (Rs 179.20 per month) and also awarded Rs 10000 as the legal costs of the appeal.  \nVI. CRITICAL ANALYSIS  \nAfter the judicial prono uncement in Shah Bano case, there were juggernaut of reactions. It \nwitnessed scandalous press coverage, vociferous protests and counter protests by so called \nstake holders of divergent religious groups. The biggest backlash of this judgement was \ncreation o f line of demarcation not only between Hindus and Muslims, but also among \ndifferent muslim sects15. Conservative muslim theologists opposed the verdict while liberal \nmuslims, hindus and feminists supported it. Many muslims were dissatisfied by the \ncredibility of the interpretation of muslim verses done by five judge bench, all having a \nbackground in secular law16. Muslim theologists were of view that it was indecorous for a \nreligiously neutral court to explore the meanings of religious law and it mig ht set a bad \nprecedent17. Muslim clergymen believed that constitutional bench while interpreting the \nverses of Quran has adopted eurocentric approach. There was a strong perception that the \n                                                      \n \n13Mulla\u2019s Principles of Mohammedan Law, 18th edition, p. 308  \n14Hamira Bibi v.

International Journal of Legal Science and Innovation    [ISSN 2581 -9453] Shah Bano judgement rather than being a simple maintenance award, w as unduly critical of \nmuslim law and islamic practices18. However, the court used the non -legislation of Uniform \nCivil Code to justify its interventionist approach in a theological issue. The role of the \nreformer has to be assumed by the courts because it is  beyond the endurance of sensitive \nminds to allow injustice to be suffered when it is so palpable. But piecemeal attempts of \ncourts to bridge the gap between personal laws cannot take the place of a common civil \ncode19. The constitutional bench while expres sing its agony over the incompetence of \nlegislature to establish a Uniform Civil Code in accordance with Article 4420 of Constitution \nof India was of concerned opinion that \u2013 Article 44 had remained a dead letter therefore \nconcrete steps were needed if the constitution of India was to have any meaning21.The \noperative part of the judgement was relatively non -controversial howbeit, the way in which it \nwas contemplated became the matter of public controversy. The vociferous reactions of a \nlarge segment of muslim s led to an anticlimax; a total volte -face. Inspite of a vigorous \ndefense of the judicial pronouncement in Parliament by muslim leader Arif Mohammed \nKhan22, the Rajiv Gandhi government crumbled under pressure and enacted Muslim Women \n(Protection of Rights i n Divorce) Act, 1986 (the MWA). Contrary to its name, the MWA \nactually undermined the far -reaching protection granted to divorced muslim women in Shah \nBano and similar other judgements. It was more in the nature of a \u2018dissolution of rights in \ndivorce\u2019 act rather than a \u2018protection of rights in divorce\u2019 act 23. According to the MWA, the \nhusband of the divorced woman is under an obligation to pay a reasonable, and fair amount \nof maintenance, only till the period of iddat . In case of children born from the wedl ock, the \nhusband is bound to pay maintenance amount for the period of two years from the respective \ndates of birth of such children. Additionally, the husband is required to pay mahr and all the \nproperties which have been given to the woman before, at or a fter marriage by her relatives \nor friends or by husband or his relatives or his friends till the period of iddat . Therefore, it can \nbe deduced that the provisions of the MWA have effectively abstained muslim widows right \nto file a maintenance under section  125 of CrPC24. What divorced women who were \nfinancially dependent on their husbands were expected to do after the expiry of iddat was \n                                                      \n \n18Josh Goodman, \u2018Divine Judgement: Judicial Review of Religious Legal Systems in India and Israel\u2019, Hasting s \nInternational and Comparative Law Review, vol. 32 (2009): p.477  \n19Supra note 1, para 35  \n20The State shall endeavour to secure for the citizens a uniform civil code throughout the territory of India.  \n21Supra note 19  \n22Bipin Chandra, Mridula Mukherjee and Aditya Mukherjee, India after Independence, New Delhi: Penguin \nBooks, 2000, p.285  \n23Zia Mody, Ten Judgements that changed India, Gurgaon: Penguin Books, 2013, p.60  \n24Madhavi Sunder, \u2018Piercing the Veil\u2019, Yale Law Journal, vol. 112 (2003): p. 1399  \n459 International Journal of Legal Science and Innovation  [Vol. 2 Iss 1; 454] \n \n\u00a9 2020. International Journal of Legal Science and Innovation    [ISSN 2581 -9453] anyone\u2019s guess25. \nMeanwhile, several High Courts started creating ruckus as to the interpretation of provisions \nof the MWA which were put a stop to in the case of Danial Latifi v. UOI26. In this case \nDanial Latifi contented that provisions of the MWA are violative of right to equality (Article \n1427 and 1528) as well as right to life (Article 2129), thereby challenging the constitu tional \nvalidity of concerned legislation. Rejecting the petition, the court observed that it is not \nviolative of constitutional provisions as the husband would not only maintain his divorced \nwife during iddat but will also pay a fair and reasonable amount o f maintenance in lumpsum \nwhich will safeguard her present and future both.  \nIt will be prejudicial to criticize the intrinsic and peripheral elements of the court\u2019s judgement \nwithout giving due respect to the ideals of egalitarianism and emancipation of wom en that the \ncourt espoused in the crux of its judgement. Many view this judgement as a vindication of the \nrights of women in Islamic law. However, this judgement can be appraised as one of the few \naccolades earned by the highest court of the land which has  historically been perceived as a \nmale dominated court in the area of women\u2019s rights30.    \nVII. CONCLUSION  \nAt the end it will be appropriate to state that the entire journey of Shah Bano case and its \naftermath was a conflict between Feminism and Secularism (Feminism v. Secularism). This \ncase acted as a mirror which reflected the unfortunate realities about what happens when \nwomen\u2019s rights and religious tenets collide in a democracy. The hasty enactment of the \nMWA showed that gender equality would succumb to the realities of pluralism 31. Though \nShah Bano did not claim her alimony from her husband, there are many divorced muslim \nwomen who will. It can only be hoped that the next Shah Bano case is met with responses \nrather than reactions by so called stake holder s of the society. \n*****  \n                                                      \n \n25Supra note 23 \n26(2001) 7 SCC 740  \n27The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the \nterritory of India Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth.  \n28Prohibition of  discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth.  \n29No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law.  \n30Supra note 23  \n31Radhika Coomaraswamy, \u2018Reinventing International Law:  Women\u2019s Rights as Human Rights in the \nInternational Community\u2019 (The Edward A Smith Lecture, Human Rights Program, Harvard Law School, 1997)  "}]}, {"role": "user", "additional_kwargs": {}, "blocks": [{"block_type": "text", "text": "Please provide a summary of this document."}]}, {"role": "assistant", "additional_kwargs": {}, "blocks": [{"block_type": "text", "text": "This article analyzes the landmark 1985 Indian Supreme Court case, <span style=\"color: #9E9E9E;\">Mohammed Ahmed Khan v.

INTROD UCTION \nIndia is a largest democratic country which rests its foundation on the ideals of equality. \nAccordingly, there persists uniform set of laws in constitution that binds all citizens, \nirrespective of religion, race, caste, sex and place of birth. However, in respect of matters \ninvolving family issues \u2013 marriage, divorce, maintenance and succession - there exists distinct \npersonal laws as per different faiths.  \nDuring 1970s and \u201980s, there were widespread conflicts as to the application of Indian laws  \non the personal affairs of the citizens who were governed by their own distinct personal laws. \nOne such area of conflict, was the applicability of Sec 125 of the Code of Criminal \nProcedure, 1973 (CrPC) on citizens of Islamic faith. As specified by this se ction, a \u2018First \nClass Magistrate could order a husband to provide a monthly allowance to his wife/divorced \nwife (as long as she had not remarried) if he neglected to maintain her and she was unable to \nmaintain herself\u2019. The primary objective of law was to ensure the emancipation of women \nwho were economically dependent on their husbands; it was a benign provision enacted to \nameliorate the economic condition of neglected wives and discarded divorcees\u20192. \nIn Islam, at the time of marriage the bride is entitled  to a \u2018marriage gift\u2019 which is known as \n                                                      \n \n1Author is a student at Vivekananda Institute Of Professional Studies, India.  \n2Bai Tahira v.

International Journal of Legal Science and Innovation    [ISSN 2581 -9453] Mahr . This can be paid either promptly or deferred to a later date (death of husband or at the \ntime of divorce). The Supreme Court encountered this issue in two cases3 : Can the payment \nof mahr (irrespective of its a mount) exonerate the liability of muslim husband under section \n125 of the CrPC? In both cases, the court gave a very liberal view and observed that payment \nof mahr will not fetter the woman\u2019s entitlement to maintenance under section 125 CrPC. \nThough signif icant, these decisions were inconspicuous and did not receive much coverage \ntill the Shah Bano case emerged.  \nII. FACTS  \nIn 1932, Mohammad Ahmed Khan a prosperous muslim lawyer4 got married with Shah Bano \nand the mahr that was fixed was Rs 3000. Out of this wedlock three sons and two daughters \nwere born. Subsequently, in 1978 he unilaterally divorced his forty -year-old wife by \npronouncing \u2018triple talaq\u2019 ( talaq -ul- biddat )5. Consequently, as per the provisions of Islamic \nLaw he paid the agreed  mahr to his div orced wife during iddat6. Having been thrashed out of \nher matrimonial home in Madhya Pradesh, she filed a petition under section 125 of the CrPC \nbefore Judicial Magistrate in Indore asking for a maintenance. The magistrate ordered the \nhusband to pay Shah B ano a meagre Rs 25 per month as maintenance. Dissatisfied with the \namount, she appealed to the Madhya Pradesh High Court in 1979, accordingly maintenance \namount was increased to Rs 179.20 per month. It was then that Shah Bano\u2019s ex -husband \npetitioned the Su preme Court in 1981 to challenge the high court\u2019s decision. He vehemently \ncontended that as per the provisions of Muslim personal law, a husband\u2019s liability to maintain \nhis wife after divorce extends only up to the iddat  period, therefore provisions of Sec 125 \nCrPC stands overruled.  \nThough, the concerned question of law was already discussed by Supreme Court in its \nprevious judgements7. However, when the matter came up before two judge bench of the \ncourt judges were of o pinion that the present judgements are not vigorous and had not been \naccurately pronounced. Therefore, in order to decide the issue involved, a five -judge \nConstitution Bench comprising of Chief Justice Y.V. Chandrachud, Justices D.A. Desai, E.S. \n                                                      \n \n3Ibid.; Fuzlunbi v. K.

International Journal of Legal Science and Innovation    [ISSN 2581 -9453] Venkataram iah, Ranganath Misra and O. Chinnappa Reddy was constituted.  \nIII. ISSUES  \nThe Supreme Court articulately framed the agonizing issues before it:  \n\uf0b7 Is Sec 125 of CrPC a secular provision?  \n\uf0b7 Is there any provision in the Muslim Personal Law under which a sum is payab le to \nthe wife \u2018on divorce\u20198? \n\uf0b7 Is the law so ruthless in its equality that, no matter how much the husband pays for the \nmaintenance of his divorced wife during the period of iddat  absolves him forever \nfrom the duty of paying adequately so as to enable her t o keep her body and soul \ntogether9? \nIV. REASONING  \nThe constitution bench unanimously mentioned en passant that Sec 125 of CrPC is a \nreligious neutral provision, whether the spouses were Hindus or Muslims, Christians or \nParsis, pagans or heathens is wholly irr elevant10. Its interpretation is that the concerned \nprovision is applicable to all persons belonging to all religions and has no relationship with \npersonal law of the parties11. It intends to serve a social purpose12.Therefore, it can be \ndeduced that underlying purpose of Sec 125 was to protect dependents from \u2018vagrancy\u2019 and \n\u2018destitution\u2019 \u2013 thus it saw no reason to exclude Muslims from its ambit.  \nThe court while drawing a line of demarcation between provisions of muslim law and Sec \n125 of CrPC was of c oncerned opinion that muslim personal law did not address the situation \nincorporated in Sec 125. The personal law allows payment of mahr during iddat but fails to \ncontemplate the situation where divorced wife is not in a condition to maintain herself after  \nthe expiration of iddat.  Thus, using \u2018deft interpretative tools\u2019 the court reconciled muslim \npersonal law and Sec 125. Therefore, court stated in existence of perceived conflict between \nthe two, the CrPC would override the provisions of muslim personal la w.  \nThe court while rejecting the argument that the order for maintenance under Sec 125 could be \ncancelled under Sec 127, simply because the husband had made a payment ( mahr in this \ncase) to the wife at the time of divorce, under muslim personal law, assid uously stated that \n                                                      \n \n8Supra note 1, para 7  \n9Supra note 1, para 3  \n10Ibid \n11Nanak Chand v. Shri Chandra Kishore Agarwal, AIR 1970 SC 446  \n12Jagir Kaur v. Jaswant Singh, AIR 1963 SC 1521  \n457 International Journal of Legal Science and Innovation  [Vol. 2 Iss 1; 454] \n \n\u00a9 2020. International Journal of Legal Science and Innovation    [ISSN 2581 -9453] mahr is not a payment liable to be paid at the time of divorce. While acknowledging the \ninterpretation of expression mahr, court came to the understanding that \u2013 it was an amount \nthat a wife is entitled to in consideration of marriage13, therefore cannot be considered as \ndivorce payment. The mere fact that mahr  was paid at the time of dissolution did not imply \nthat the payment was \u2018occasioned by divorce\u2019. Thus, defining mahr as a marriage \npayment14rather than divorce payment, the court emph asized that payment of mahr could not \nrestrain courts from awarding maintenance.  \nV. DISPOSITION  \nThe concordant opinions of five judge bench were: Firstly, Sec 125 of CrPC is a secular \nprovision which is applicable to all citizens irrespective of their religi on. Secondly, a \ndivorced muslim woman who is not able to maintain herself is entitled to claim compensation \nunder sec 125 of CrPC till she gets remarried. Lastly, if divorced muslim woman is able to \nmaintain herself then she is entitled to maintenance up t o the period of iddat. Accordingly, \nthe court unanimously reiterated the amount of compensation fixed by Madhya Pradesh High \nCourt (Rs 179.20 per month) and also awarded Rs 10000 as the legal costs of the appeal.  \nVI. CRITICAL ANALYSIS  \nAfter the judicial prono uncement in Shah Bano case, there were juggernaut of reactions. It \nwitnessed scandalous press coverage, vociferous protests and counter protests by so called \nstake holders of divergent religious groups. The biggest backlash of this judgement was \ncreation o f line of demarcation not only between Hindus and Muslims, but also among \ndifferent muslim sects15. Conservative muslim theologists opposed the verdict while liberal \nmuslims, hindus and feminists supported it. Many muslims were dissatisfied by the \ncredibility of the interpretation of muslim verses done by five judge bench, all having a \nbackground in secular law16. Muslim theologists were of view that it was indecorous for a \nreligiously neutral court to explore the meanings of religious law and it mig ht set a bad \nprecedent17. Muslim clergymen believed that constitutional bench while interpreting the \nverses of Quran has adopted eurocentric approach. There was a strong perception that the \n                                                      \n \n13Mulla\u2019s Principles of Mohammedan Law, 18th edition, p. 308  \n14Hamira Bibi v.

International Journal of Legal Science and Innovation    [ISSN 2581 -9453] Shah Bano judgement rather than being a simple maintenance award, w as unduly critical of \nmuslim law and islamic practices18. However, the court used the non -legislation of Uniform \nCivil Code to justify its interventionist approach in a theological issue. The role of the \nreformer has to be assumed by the courts because it is  beyond the endurance of sensitive \nminds to allow injustice to be suffered when it is so palpable. But piecemeal attempts of \ncourts to bridge the gap between personal laws cannot take the place of a common civil \ncode19. The constitutional bench while expres sing its agony over the incompetence of \nlegislature to establish a Uniform Civil Code in accordance with Article 4420 of Constitution \nof India was of concerned opinion that \u2013 Article 44 had remained a dead letter therefore \nconcrete steps were needed if the constitution of India was to have any meaning21.The \noperative part of the judgement was relatively non -controversial howbeit, the way in which it \nwas contemplated became the matter of public controversy. The vociferous reactions of a \nlarge segment of muslim s led to an anticlimax; a total volte -face. Inspite of a vigorous \ndefense of the judicial pronouncement in Parliament by muslim leader Arif Mohammed \nKhan22, the Rajiv Gandhi government crumbled under pressure and enacted Muslim Women \n(Protection of Rights i n Divorce) Act, 1986 (the MWA). Contrary to its name, the MWA \nactually undermined the far -reaching protection granted to divorced muslim women in Shah \nBano and similar other judgements. It was more in the nature of a \u2018dissolution of rights in \ndivorce\u2019 act rather than a \u2018protection of rights in divorce\u2019 act 23. According to the MWA, the \nhusband of the divorced woman is under an obligation to pay a reasonable, and fair amount \nof maintenance, only till the period of iddat . In case of children born from the wedl ock, the \nhusband is bound to pay maintenance amount for the period of two years from the respective \ndates of birth of such children. Additionally, the husband is required to pay mahr and all the \nproperties which have been given to the woman before, at or a fter marriage by her relatives \nor friends or by husband or his relatives or his friends till the period of iddat . Therefore, it can \nbe deduced that the provisions of the MWA have effectively abstained muslim widows right \nto file a maintenance under section  125 of CrPC24. What divorced women who were \nfinancially dependent on their husbands were expected to do after the expiry of iddat was \n                                                      \n \n18Josh Goodman, \u2018Divine Judgement: Judicial Review of Religious Legal Systems in India and Israel\u2019, Hasting s \nInternational and Comparative Law Review, vol. 32 (2009): p.477  \n19Supra note 1, para 35  \n20The State shall endeavour to secure for the citizens a uniform civil code throughout the territory of India.  \n21Supra note 19  \n22Bipin Chandra, Mridula Mukherjee and Aditya Mukherjee, India after Independence, New Delhi: Penguin \nBooks, 2000, p.285  \n23Zia Mody, Ten Judgements that changed India, Gurgaon: Penguin Books, 2013, p.60  \n24Madhavi Sunder, \u2018Piercing the Veil\u2019, Yale Law Journal, vol. 112 (2003): p. 1399  \n459 International Journal of Legal Science and Innovation  [Vol. 2 Iss 1; 454] \n \n\u00a9 2020. International Journal of Legal Science and Innovation    [ISSN 2581 -9453] anyone\u2019s guess25. \nMeanwhile, several High Courts started creating ruckus as to the interpretation of provisions \nof the MWA which were put a stop to in the case of Danial Latifi v. UOI26. In this case \nDanial Latifi contented that provisions of the MWA are violative of right to equality (Article \n1427 and 1528) as well as right to life (Article 2129), thereby challenging the constitu tional \nvalidity of concerned legislation. Rejecting the petition, the court observed that it is not \nviolative of constitutional provisions as the husband would not only maintain his divorced \nwife during iddat but will also pay a fair and reasonable amount o f maintenance in lumpsum \nwhich will safeguard her present and future both.  \nIt will be prejudicial to criticize the intrinsic and peripheral elements of the court\u2019s judgement \nwithout giving due respect to the ideals of egalitarianism and emancipation of wom en that the \ncourt espoused in the crux of its judgement. Many view this judgement as a vindication of the \nrights of women in Islamic law. However, this judgement can be appraised as one of the few \naccolades earned by the highest court of the land which has  historically been perceived as a \nmale dominated court in the area of women\u2019s rights30.    \nVII. CONCLUSION  \nAt the end it will be appropriate to state that the entire journey of Shah Bano case and its \naftermath was a conflict between Feminism and Secularism (Feminism v. Secularism). This \ncase acted as a mirror which reflected the unfortunate realities about what happens when \nwomen\u2019s rights and religious tenets collide in a democracy. The hasty enactment of the \nMWA showed that gender equality would succumb to the realities of pluralism 31. Though \nShah Bano did not claim her alimony from her husband, there are many divorced muslim \nwomen who will. It can only be hoped that the next Shah Bano case is met with responses \nrather than reactions by so called stake holder s of the society. \n*****  \n                                                      \n \n25Supra note 23 \n26(2001) 7 SCC 740  \n27The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the \nterritory of India Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth.  \n28Prohibition of  discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth.  \n29No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law.  \n30Supra note 23  \n31Radhika Coomaraswamy, \u2018Reinventing International Law:  Women\u2019s Rights as Human Rights in the \nInternational Community\u2019 (The Edward A Smith Lecture, Human Rights Program, Harvard Law School, 1997)  "}, {"role": "user", "content": "Please provide a summary of this document."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This document analyzes the landmark Indian Supreme Court case, <span style=\"color: #9E9E9E;\">Mohammed Ahmed Khan v.
