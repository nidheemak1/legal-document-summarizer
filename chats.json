Therefore, the categories and color codes for rental agreements are not applicable.  However, we can analyze the clauses using similar categories and highlight the potential risks.

It grants the developer the right to make substantial changes to the building's design without proportionately affecting the unit's value, creating substantial risk.\n\n\n\ud83d\udccc Clause: Rights of the Developer to Develop Project Land (\ud83d\udfe0 PROPERTY CLAUSES)\n(Sections 8.1-8.8 outlining developer's rights to phase-wise development)\n\ud83d\udd39 Category: Property Clauses\n\ud83d\udd39 Highlight Color: Orange\n\ud83d\udd39 \u26a0 Risk Warning:  The developer's extensive rights to alter plans and constructions create significant risk for the buyer.\n\n\n\ud83d\udccc Clause: Maintenance (\ud83d\udfe2 FINANCIAL CLAUSES)\nDescribes maintenance responsibilities and charges.\n\ud83d\udd39 Category: Financial Clauses\n\ud83d\udd39 Highlight Color: Green\n\ud83d\udd39 \u26a0 Risk Warning:  The provisional monthly contribution is presented as approximate and subject to change, creating uncertainty for the buyer.\n\n\n\ud83d\udccc Clause: Obligations of the Purchaser/s (\ud83d\udfe0 PROPERTY CLAUSES)\n(Sections 10.1-10.14 outlining buyer responsibilities and restrictions)\n\ud83d\udd39 Category: Property Clauses\n\ud83d\udd39 Highlight Color: Orange\n\ud83d\udd39 \u26a0 Risk Warning: Many restrictions on the buyer's use of the unit and the building.

This appeal under Section 125 of the of the Electricity Act, 2003 (hereinafter for short \"the Act\") is\ndirected against the judgment and order dated 29th March, 2006 passed by the Appellate Tribunal\nfor Electricity whereby the Appellate Tribunal has allowed the appeals filed by the distribution\ncompanies and set aside the orders passed by the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission\n(hereinafter for short \"The Commission\") dated 23.2.2005. The Commission on 3.8.2004 addressed\na notice to all its licensees/distribution companies in Maharashtra and made an inquiry from them\nwith regard to raising of the bills by the said licensees/distribution companies on the basis other\nthan the actual meter reading for the relevant period, when large variations in consumption were\nnoticed, or for other reasons. The notice dated 3.8.2004 sent by the Commission to all its\nlicensees/distribution companies reads as under :-\n\"Several instances have come to the Commission's notice of so- called \"amendment\",\n\"supplementary\" or other such bills being raised by some licensees to consumers,\noften several years later, on a basis other than the actual meter reading for the\nrelevant period, when large variations in consumption are noticed, or for other\nreasons. Computerised systems have sometimes been put in place which generate\nsuch bills automatically. Wide variations observed in recorded consumption andMaharashtra Electricity Regulatory ... vs Reliance Energy Ltd. & Ors on 14 August, 2007\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/464821/ 1\nother such apparent anomalies may be useful for monitoring, checking/testing of\nmeters and for taking corrective action. However, billing on a basis other than\nrecorded consumption, and raising amended bills accordingly (often after several\nyears later, and without giving reasons), is not mandated by law.\nThe electricity statutes (in the past, and at present) provide inter alia that, in case of\nmetered consumers, energy consumption charges have to be billed on the basis of\nmeter readings. Moreover, the licensee, and not the consumer, is responsible for\nmaintaining, rectifying, or having such meters replaced where necessary. Thus, no\n\"amendment\" bills of the kind referred to above can be raised, and any additional\nbilling has to follow due process and the provision of law. In the context of such\n\"amendment\" bills, I am directed to ask that the billing practices followed be\nimmediately reviewed and brought into conformity with the statutory provisions. An\naffidavit stating the corrective action taken (including withdrawal of all such pending\nbills, and refund, though adjustment in energy bills or otherwise, of amounts received\nfrom consumers on or after 10.6.2003) may be furnished by 3rd September, 2004.\"\n2. In response to the said notice all the licensees/distribution companies in Maharashtra made their\nrespective submissions before the Commission explaining under what circumstances the\nsupplementary/amended bills were sent to the consumers. They tried to justify raising of such bills\nand stated that the these bills were rightly sent as they found that some time the meters were not\nregistering proper consumption and on that basis they tried to justify their action.\n3. The Commission examined the matter in detail and vide its order dated 23.2.2005 in para 46\ndirected as under:-\n\"46. After considering all these factors and the submissions made, the Commission\ndirects that the supplementary/amendment bills issued in the circumstances set out\nat para 42 and 43 above from 10th June, 2003 (the date of coming into force of EA,\n2003) and upto notification of the Supply Code.\na. should be withdrawn, if due meter testing has not been done with the results\nintimated to the consumer. b. any amounts collected should be refunded to the\nconcerned consumers (without interest considering the earlier lack of clarity on this\nmeter on the part of the licensees);\nc. where meters have been found to be defective upon subsequent due testing (and\nthe results intimated to the consumer), the bills may be adjusted for upto 3 months\nprior to the date of testing or meter replacement, whichever is earlier, and any\namounts recovered in excess refunded without interest (in the case of 'stopped'\nmeters, the analogy of the Supply Code provisions should be applied for assessment);\nd. the above action should be completed by 30th May, 2005, so as to give the\nlicensees more than 3 months' time in view of the work likely to be involved;Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory ... vs Reliance Energy Ltd. & Ors on 14 August, 2007\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/464821/ 2\ne. compliance should be submitted on affidavit by 15th June, 2005, with a list of\nconsumers involved, and certifying that no further action remains to be done in\nterms of this Order.\"\nBy another order dated 23.8.2005 in the case of M/s. Prayas (Energy Group) Pune, the Commission\nin para 45 directed as under :-\n\"45. Considering the foregoing, the Commission disposes of Prayas' petition with the\nfollowing directions, which would apply for the period from 1st June, 2004 (i.e.\naround 3 months after the detailed Tariff Order dated 10th March, 2004, uptil 19th\nJanuary, 2005 (following which the Supply code Regulations were notified):\n(a) no billing using past consumption or some related 'average' basis should be\nresorted to for more than a period of 3 months. (where average billing has been\ncontinuing for more than that period just prior to 1st June, 2004, then it cannot be\ncontinued from that date.\nIn case average billing has been resorted to for, say, 2 months prior to that, it can be continued only\nfor upto one month more). During that period 3 months, the meter should have been\ntested/replaced, with the results intimated to the consumer, and appropriate bill adjustments\ncarried out thereafter (where such average billing is being done on the basis of presumed faulty\nmeter, and where defectiveness of the meter has accordingly been established). If due and timely\ndiligence has not been exercised by the licensee, he cannot claim the right to continue billing on a\npresumptive, average basis. The same principle will apply to all other situations in which such\n'average' billing has been resorted to, except in cases where the meter is not accessible. (However,\nthe Commission notes that, in the case of locked/inaccesible meters, the licensees have recourse to\nthe remedies provided under Section 163 of EA, 2003, and it would be expected that MSEB would\nexercise it sooner rather than later).\n(b) In all cases where bills have been raised and/or recoveries made which are not in accordance\nwith (a) above, the bills should be withdrawn and/or amounts refunded to the consumers, through\nenergy bills or other means, as may be relevant, by 30th November, 2005, with interest at the same\nrate as payable by consumers to MSEB for delayed payments.\"\n4. Aggrieved against both these orders, the matter was taken up in appeal before the Appellate\nAuthority. The Appellate Authority by the impugned order dated 29th March, 2006 set aside the\norders passed by the Commission and directed that each consumer should approach the forum\ncreated under Section 42(5) of the Act for the individual grievances. 5. Aggrieved against the order\ndated 29.3.2006 passed by the Appellate Authority, the present appeal has been filed under Section\n125 of the Act.\n6. We have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record.Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory ... vs Reliance Energy Ltd. & Ors on 14 August, 2007\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/464821/ 3\n7. Learned counsel for the appellant-Commission has submitted before us that the Commission has\nthe power to give a general direction to its licensees/distribution companies and he also submitted\nthat in exercise of the power under the Act, the Commission was competent to issue the aforesaid\ndirection. As against this, the learned counsel appearing for the respondent-licensees/distribution\ncompanies submitted that the Commission has no power to issue a direction like the one issued in\nthe present case and entertain individual complaints and direct refund of the whole amount by a\nblanket order.\n8. The question before us is : what is the power of the Commission and to what extent the\nCommission can issue directions. Suffice it to say that the Regulatory Commission was constituted\nunder the Electricity Act, 2003. The Act was a new enactment which was promulgated by\nsuperseding the Indian Electricity Act, 1910 and the Electricity Supply Act, 1948. The Statement of\nObjects and Reasons of the Act which have been summarized in the Preamble, reads as under:-\n\"An Act to consolidate the laws relating to generation, transmission, distribution,\ntrading and use of electricity and generally for taking measures conducive to\ndevelopment of electricity industry, promoting competition therein, protecting\ninterest of consumers and supply of electricity to all areas, rationalisation of\nelectricity tariff, ensuring transparent policies regarding subsidies, promotion of\nefficient and environmentally benign policies, constitution of Central Electricity\nAuthority, Regulatory Commissions and establishment of Appellate Tribunal and for\nmatters connected therewith or incidental thereto.\"\n\"Appropriate Commission\" as defined in Section 2(4) of the Act means the \"Central\nRegulatory Commission referred to in sub-section (1) of Section 76 or the State\nRegulatory Commission referred to in Section 82 or the Joint Commission referred to\nin Section 83, as the case may be\". In exercise of its power under Section 82 of the\nAct, the State of Maharashtra constituted the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory\nCommission. The Commission exercises all the powers which are enumerated in the\nAct. Though various provisions were pointed out to us by learned counsel for the\nparties, but Section 82 which is relevant for our purposes reads as under :-\n\"82. Constitution of State Commission-(1) Every State Government shall, within six\nmonths from the appointed date, by notification, constitute for the purposes of this\nAct, a Commission for the State to be known as the (name of the State) Electricity\nRegulatory Commission :\nProvided that the State Electricity Regulatory Commission, established by a State\nGovernment under Section 17 of the Electricity Regulatory Commissions Act, 1998\n(14 of 1998) and the enactments specified in the Schedule, and functioning as such\nimmediately before the appointed date shall be the State Commission for the\npurposes of this Act and the Chairperson, Members, Secretary, and officers and other\nemployees thereof shall continue to hold office on the same terms and conditions on\nwhich they were appointed under those Acts :Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory ... vs Reliance Energy Ltd. & Ors on 14 August, 2007\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/464821/ 4\nProvided further that the Chairperson and other Members of the State Commission,\nappointed, before the commencement of this Act, under the Electricity Regulatory\nCommissions Act, 1998 (14 of 1998) or under the enactments specified in the\nSchedule, may, on the recommendations of the Selection Committee constituted\nunder sub-section (1) of Section 85, be allowed to opt for the terms and conditions\nunder this Act by the concerned State Government. (2) The State Commission shall\nbe a body corporate by the name aforesaid, having perpetual succession and a\ncommon seal, with power to acquire, hold and dispose of property, both movable and\nimmovable, and to contract and shall, by the said name, sue or be sued.\n(3) The head office of the State Commission shall be at such place as the State\nGovernment may, by notification, specify.\n(4) The State Commission shall consist of not more than three Members, including\nthe Chairperson. (5) The Chairperson and Members of the State Commission shall be\nappointed by the State Government on the recommendation of a Selection\nCommittee referred to in Section 85.\"\n9. We are not concerned with the provisions of appointment of Members of the Commission as they\nare dealt with by Sections 84 and 85 of the Act. Section 86 deals with the functions of the\nCommission and is relevant for our purposes. For ready reference, the same is reproduced\nhereunder.\n\"86. Functions of State Commission:- (1) The State Commission shall discharge the\nfollowing functions, namely :-\n(a) determine the tariff for generation, supply, transmission and wheeling of\nelectricity, wholesale, bulk or retail, as the case may be, withing the State:\nProvided that where open access has been permitted to a category of consumers\nunder section 42, the State Commission shall determine only the wheeling charges\nand surcharge thereon, if any, for the said category of consumers;\n(b) regulate electricity purchase and procurement process of distribution of licensees\nincluding the price at which electricity shall be procured from the generating\ncompanies or licensees or from other sources through agreements for purchase of\npower for distribution and supply within the State;\n(c) facilitate intra-State transmission and wheeling of electricity;\n(d) issue licences to persons seeking to act as transmission licensees, distribution\nlicensees and electricity traders with respect to their operations within the State;Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory ... vs Reliance Energy Ltd. & Ors on 14 August, 2007\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/464821/ 5\n(e) promote congeneration and generation of electricity from renewable sources of\nenergy by providing suitable measures for connectivity with the grid and sale of\nelectricity to any person, and also specify, for purchase of electricity from such\nsources, a percentage of the total consumption of electricity in the area of a\ndistribution licensee;\n(f) adjudicate upon the disputes between the licensees and generating companies and\nto refer any dispute for arbitration;\n(g) levy fee for the purposes of the Act;\n(h) specify State Grid Code consistent with the Grid Code specified under clause (h)\nof sub-section (1) of Section 79;\n(i) specify or enforce standards with respect to quality, continuity and reliability of\nservice by licensees;\n(j) fix the trading margin in the intra-State trading of electricity, if considered,\nnecessary;\n(k) discharge such other functions as may be assigned to it under this Act.\n(2) The State Commission shall advise the State Government on all or any of the\nfollowing matters, namely :-\n(i) promotion of competition, efficiency and economy in activities of the electricity\nindustry;\n(ii) promotion of investment in electricity industry;\n(iii)reorganisation and restructuring of electricity industry in the State;\n(iv) matters concerning generation, transmission, distribution and trading of\nelectricity or any other matter referred to the State Commission by that Government;\n(3) The State Commission shall ensure transparency while exercising its powers and\ndischarging its functions. (4) In discharge of its functions, the State Commission shall\nbe guided by the National Electricity Policy, National Electricity Plan and Tariff\nPolicy published under section\n3.\n10. Thus, from the above provision it is clear that the primary purpose of the Commission is to\ndetermine tariff for generation, supply, transmission of electricity etc. and to regulate the electricityMaharashtra Electricity Regulatory ... vs Reliance Energy Ltd. & Ors on 14 August, 2007\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/464821/ 6\npurchase and procurement process of distribution licensees, to facilitate intra-State transmission, to\npromote congeneration and generation of electricity from renewable sources of energy, to adjudicate\nupon the disputes between the licensees and generation companies and to refer any dispute for\narbitration, to levy fee for the purposes of this Act, specify State Grade Code consistent with the Grid\nCode specified under clause (h) of sub-section (1) of Section\n79. Sub-Section (2) of Section 86 also empowers the State Commission to advise the State\nGovernment on any of the matters including promotion of competition, efficiency, matters\nconcerning generation, transmission, distribution and trading of electricity etc. Sub-Section (3)\nprovides that the Commission shall ensure transparency while exercising its powers and discharging\nits functions. Sub-section (4) provides that in discharge of its functions the Commission shall be\nguided by the National Electricity Policy, National Electricity Plan and Tariff Policy published under\nSection 3.\n11. We are not going into other questions as to how licenses were granted to all these utilities, i.e.,\nvarious distribution companies. It is not necessary for us to go into these questions as in the present\ncase, we are primarily concerned to decide the powers of the Commission and to what extent it can\nissue directions and whether the direction given by the Commission in the present case is\nsustainable or not.\n12. It may be noted from a perusal of Section 86(1)(f) of the Act that the State Government has only\npower to adjudicate upon disputes between licensees and generating companies. It follows that the\nCommission cannot adjudicate disputes relating to grievances of individual consumers. The\nadjudicatory function of the Commission is thus limited to the matter prescribed in Section 86(1)(f).\n13. Section 14 of the Act provides for grant of licence; Section 16 provides for conditions of licence;\nSection 61 lays down the tariff regulations and Section 62 provides for determination of tariff. The\nCommission under Section 94 has civil powers also and under Section 96 it has power of entry and\nseizure. Under Section 126 the Commission has the power to investigate and make assessment.\nSection 127 provides for an appeal to the appellate authority. Under Section 128 the Commission\ncan make investigation of certain matters where it is satisfied that the licensee has failed to comply\nwith any of the conditions of licence or failed to comply with any of the provisions of the Act or the\nrules and regulations made thereunder. Sub-Section (6) of Section 128 empowers the Commission\nto take any action against the licensee/generating company. Sub-section (6) reads as under :-\n(6) On receipt of any report under sub-section (1) or sub-section (5), the Appropriate\nCommission may, after giving such opportunity to the licensee or generating\ncompany, as the case may be, to make a representation in connection with the report\nas in the opinion of the Appropriate Commission seems reasonable, by order in\nwriting :-\n(a) require the licensee or the generating company to take such action in respect of\nany matter arising out of the report as the Appropriate Commission may think fit; orMaharashtra Electricity Regulatory ... vs Reliance Energy Ltd. & Ors on 14 August, 2007\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/464821/ 7\n(b) cancel the licence; or\n(c) direct the generating company to cease to carry on the business of generation of\nelectricity.\nSection 142 of the Act provides for punishment for non-compliance of directions issued by the\nCommission and Section 143 empowers the Commission to adjudicate after holding an inquiry in\nsuch manner as may be prescribed by the Government. Section 181 empowers the Commission to\nmake regulations.\n14. A comprehensive reading of all these provisions leaves no manner of doubt that the Commission\nis empowered with all powers right from granting licence and laying down the conditions of licence\nand to frame regulations and to see that the same are properly enforced and also power to enforce\nthe conditions of licence under sub- section (6) of Section 128.\n15. Thus, insofar as the first contention of the learned counsel for the respondents that the\nCommission has no power is concerned, we are of the view that the same is wrong. In this behalf the\nprovisions of The Electricity Act, 2003 are quite clear and categoric and Section 128(6) empowers\nthe Commission to get the conditions of licence enforced. But the question is whether the said power\nunder Section 128(6) has been rightly exercised by the Commission or not. After clearing the first\nhurdle, that the Commission has power to issue directions, we shall now examine whether the\ndirection given by the Commission in the present case is correct or not.\n16. When the Commission received a spate of complaints from consumers against its\nlicensees/distribution companies that they are arbitrarily issuing supplementary/amended bills and\ncharging excess amounts for supply of electricity, it felt persuaded to invoke its general power to\nsupervise the licensees/distribution companies and in that connection issued notice dated 3.8.2004.\nThere can be no manner of doubt that the Commission has full power to pull up any of its licensee or\ndistribution company to see that the rules and regulations laid down by the Commission are\nproperly complied with. After all, it is the duty of the Commission under Sections 45(5), 55(2), 57,\n62, 86, 128, 129, 181 and other provisions of the Act to ensure that the public is not harassed.\n17. In exercise of this general power notice dated 3.8.2004 was issued when mass scale\nsupplementary/amended bills were issued to the consumers. When these consumers approached\nthe Commission, the Commission directed its licensees to immediately review their billing policies\nand bring the same in conformity with the statutory provisions of the Act. The Commission did not\nget an investigation made under Section 128(1) which it could have done, and without that, and\nwithout getting a report under Section 128(5) it passed an order directing refund of the amounts\ncollected by the licensees/distribution companies, which in our opinion was not permissible, since\nsuch a direction could, if at all, be given after getting a report of the investigation agency. The\nCommission could have made an investigation and got a report from the investigation agency and\non that basis directions could have been given. However, that was not done. In these circumstances,\nin our opinion, the view taken by the Appellate Authority in the impugned order to that extent is\ncorrect that the individual consumers should have approached the appropriate forum under SectionMaharashtra Electricity Regulatory ... vs Reliance Energy Ltd. & Ors on 14 August, 2007\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/464821/ 8\n42(5) of the Act.\n18. Thus while we hold that the Commission has power to issue a general direction to licencees that\nthey should abide by conditions of the licence issued by them and charge only as per the tariff fixed\nunder the Act so that the public at large should not be harassed, we are of the opinion that so far as\nthe blanket direction given by the Commission for refunding the entire amount without making a\nproper investigation whether the issue of supplementary/amended bills was really warranted in\nevery case or not is unsustainable. Here the Commission has gone beyond its jurisdiction. After all\nthe distribution/ generating companies have to incur expenses for generation/distribution of power,\nand we cannot at the same time give license to the consumers to commit theft of electricity or to be\nbenefited by improper functioning of the meter to the disadvantage of the distribution/generating\ncompany. Thus, keeping in view the equity of both the parties, we think it will be proper for us to\ndirect that all the licensees/distribution companies in the State of Maharashtra issue a general\npublic notice in two daily newspapers having wide circulation in the State, one English newspaper\nand one in vernacular language. The notice shall state that whoever feels aggrieved by the\nsupplementary/amended bill, he/she can approach the licensee/distribution company for redressal\nof their grievance within a period of three months from the date of publication of the notice. In our\nview, that would meet the ends of justice instead of passing a blanket order as given by the\nCommission for refunding the money charged by the licensees/distribution companies by issuing\nsupplementary/amended bills. The individual consumers may make a grievance before the\nlicensee/distribution company that they have not consumed the electricity for which they are\ncharged or that the meter reading was not proper or that they have been excessively charged for the\npower which they have not actually consumed. Therefore, we direct that all the\nlicensees/distribution companies shall issue a public notice in two daily newspapers having wide\ncirculation in the State of Maharashtra, one in English language and the other in vernacular\nlanguage requiring their respective consumers to make their representations for redressal of their\ngrievances in respect of the supplementary/amended bills. The licensees/distribution companies\nshall decide the individual cases received by them after giving a fair opportunity of hearing to the\nconsumers. The consumers who still feel not satisfied with the order passed by the\nlicensees/distribution companies can approach the appropriate forum constituted under Section\n42(5) of the Act and, if still not satisfied, with the order passed by the appropriate forum to\napproach the Ombudsman under Section 42(6) of the Act. Accordingly, we hold that while the\nCommission had a power to issue general directions to prevent harassment to the public at large by\nits licensees/distribution companies, but a blanket direction to refund the amounts collected by the\nlicensees/distribution companies which has been given by the Commission was not warranted.\n19. Although, the Appellate Authority has set aside the order passed by the Commission and issued a\ndirection that the individual consumers may approach the appropriate orders under Sections 42(5)\nand (6) we are not interfering with that direction, but we direct that before that the\nlicensees/distribution companies shall hear the parties as directed hereinabove and decide whether\nthe supplementary/amended bills issued by them are proper or not.\n20. In view of the above discussion, this appeal stands disposed of with no order as to costs.Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory ... vs Reliance Energy Ltd. & Ors on 14 August, 2007\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/464821/ 9"}]}, {"role": "user", "additional_kwargs": {}, "blocks": [{"block_type": "text", "text": "Summary"}]}, {"role": "assistant", "additional_kwargs": {}, "blocks": [{"block_type": "text", "text": "- Commission's Powers: `Regulatory Oversight` \u26aa  General info\n- Billing Disputes: `Consumer Complaints` \u26aa General info\n- Commission's Order: `Refund Directive` \ud83d\udd34  \u26a0 Blanket refund order deemed unsustainable.\n- Appellate Authority Decision: `Individual Grievance` \u26aa General info\n- Final Ruling: `Public Notice + Individual Redressal` \u26aa General info\n"}]}], "Maharashtra_Electricity_Regulatory_vs_Reliance_Energy_Ltd_Ors_on_14_August_2007.PDF-20250331181412": [{"role": "system", "content": "\nYou are a legal assistant specializing in **concise** analysis of Indian legal documents.  \nYour task is to **identify key clauses** and **summarize them in a few words**, ensuring clarity and brevity.  \n\n### **Response Format:**  \n- **Clause Title:** `[Brief Name]`  \n  - **Category:** `[Color Emoji + Short Label]`  \n  - **Risk Warning (\u26a0 if applicable):** `[1-line risk insight]`  \n\n### **Color Codes:**  \n- \ud83d\udfe2 **Green** \u2192 Standard financial clauses  \n- \ud83d\udd35 **Blue** \u2192 Security-related clauses  \n- \ud83d\udfe1 **Yellow** \u2192 Duration/termination clauses  \n- \ud83d\udfe0 **Orange** \u2192 Property usage clauses  \n- \ud83d\udd34 **Red** \u2192 Penalty clauses  \n- \u26aa **White** \u2192 General info  \n\n### **Risk Warnings (\u26a0) for:**  \n- **High penalties, short notices, tenant restrictions, liability waivers, auto-renewals**  \n\n\ud83d\ude80 **Keep the response ultra-concise!** No lengthy explanations\u2014just key takeaways.  \n\n\n**PDF Context:**\n\nMaharashtra Electricity Regulatory ... vs Reliance Energy Ltd. &\nOrs on 14 August, 2007\nEquivalent citations: AIR 2008 SUPREME COURT 976, 2008 AIR SCW 513,\n2008 (2) AIR BOM R 119, 2007 (8) SCC 381, (2007) 10 SCALE 279, (2007) 2\nWLC(SC)CVL 777, (2007) 4 ALL WC 3662, 2008 (4) ALLMR (NOC) 1, (2008) 1\nBOM CR 738\nBench: A.K.Mathur, Markandey Katju\n           CASE NO.:\nAppeal (civil)  2846 of 2006\nPETITIONER:\nMaharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission\nRESPONDENT:\nReliance Energy Ltd. & Ors.\nDATE OF JUDGMENT: 14/08/2007\nBENCH:\nA.K.MATHUR & MARKANDEY KATJU\nJUDGMENT:\nJ U D G M E N T\n1. This appeal under Section 125 of the of the Electricity Act, 2003 (hereinafter for short \"the Act\") is\ndirected against the judgment and order dated 29th March, 2006 passed by the Appellate Tribunal\nfor Electricity whereby the Appellate Tribunal has allowed the appeals filed by the distribution\ncompanies and set aside the orders passed by the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission\n(hereinafter for short \"The Commission\") dated 23.2.2005. The Commission on 3.8.2004 addressed\na notice to all its licensees/distribution companies in Maharashtra and made an inquiry from them\nwith regard to raising of the bills by the said licensees/distribution companies on the basis other\nthan the actual meter reading for the relevant period, when large variations in consumption were\nnoticed, or for other reasons. The notice dated 3.8.2004 sent by the Commission to all its\nlicensees/distribution companies reads as under :-\n\"Several instances have come to the Commission's notice of so- called \"amendment\",\n\"supplementary\" or other such bills being raised by some licensees to consumers,\noften several years later, on a basis other than the actual meter reading for the\nrelevant period, when large variations in consumption are noticed, or for other\nreasons. Computerised systems have sometimes been put in place which generate\nsuch bills automatically. Wide variations observed in recorded consumption andMaharashtra Electricity Regulatory ... vs Reliance Energy Ltd. & Ors on 14 August, 2007\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/464821/ 1\nother such apparent anomalies may be useful for monitoring, checking/testing of\nmeters and for taking corrective action. However, billing on a basis other than\nrecorded consumption, and raising amended bills accordingly (often after several\nyears later, and without giving reasons), is not mandated by law.\nThe electricity statutes (in the past, and at present) provide inter alia that, in case of\nmetered consumers, energy consumption charges have to be billed on the basis of\nmeter readings. Moreover, the licensee, and not the consumer, is responsible for\nmaintaining, rectifying, or having such meters replaced where necessary. Thus, no\n\"amendment\" bills of the kind referred to above can be raised, and any additional\nbilling has to follow due process and the provision of law. In the context of such\n\"amendment\" bills, I am directed to ask that the billing practices followed be\nimmediately reviewed and brought into conformity with the statutory provisions. An\naffidavit stating the corrective action taken (including withdrawal of all such pending\nbills, and refund, though adjustment in energy bills or otherwise, of amounts received\nfrom consumers on or after 10.6.2003) may be furnished by 3rd September, 2004.\"\n2. In response to the said notice all the licensees/distribution companies in Maharashtra made their\nrespective submissions before the Commission explaining under what circumstances the\nsupplementary/amended bills were sent to the consumers. They tried to justify raising of such bills\nand stated that the these bills were rightly sent as they found that some time the meters were not\nregistering proper consumption and on that basis they tried to justify their action.\n3. The Commission examined the matter in detail and vide its order dated 23.2.2005 in para 46\ndirected as under:-\n\"46. After considering all these factors and the submissions made, the Commission\ndirects that the supplementary/amendment bills issued in the circumstances set out\nat para 42 and 43 above from 10th June, 2003 (the date of coming into force of EA,\n2003) and upto notification of the Supply Code.\na. should be withdrawn, if due meter testing has not been done with the results\nintimated to the consumer. b. any amounts collected should be refunded to the\nconcerned consumers (without interest considering the earlier lack of clarity on this\nmeter on the part of the licensees);\nc. where meters have been found to be defective upon subsequent due testing (and\nthe results intimated to the consumer), the bills may be adjusted for upto 3 months\nprior to the date of testing or meter replacement, whichever is earlier, and any\namounts recovered in excess refunded without interest (in the case of 'stopped'\nmeters, the analogy of the Supply Code provisions should be applied for assessment);\nd. the above action should be completed by 30th May, 2005, so as to give the\nlicensees more than 3 months' time in view of the work likely to be involved;Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory ... vs Reliance Energy Ltd. & Ors on 14 August, 2007\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/464821/ 2\ne. compliance should be submitted on affidavit by 15th June, 2005, with a list of\nconsumers involved, and certifying that no further action remains to be done in\nterms of this Order.\"\nBy another order dated 23.8.2005 in the case of M/s. Prayas (Energy Group) Pune, the Commission\nin para 45 directed as under :-\n\"45. Considering the foregoing, the Commission disposes of Prayas' petition with the\nfollowing directions, which would apply for the period from 1st June, 2004 (i.e.\naround 3 months after the detailed Tariff Order dated 10th March, 2004, uptil 19th\nJanuary, 2005 (following which the Supply code Regulations were notified):\n(a) no billing using past consumption or some related 'average' basis should be\nresorted to for more than a period of 3 months. (where average billing has been\ncontinuing for more than that period just prior to 1st June, 2004, then it cannot be\ncontinued from that date.\nIn case average billing has been resorted to for, say, 2 months prior to that, it can be continued only\nfor upto one month more). During that period 3 months, the meter should have been\ntested/replaced, with the results intimated to the consumer, and appropriate bill adjustments\ncarried out thereafter (where such average billing is being done on the basis of presumed faulty\nmeter, and where defectiveness of the meter has accordingly been established). If due and timely\ndiligence has not been exercised by the licensee, he cannot claim the right to continue billing on a\npresumptive, average basis. The same principle will apply to all other situations in which such\n'average' billing has been resorted to, except in cases where the meter is not accessible. (However,\nthe Commission notes that, in the case of locked/inaccesible meters, the licensees have recourse to\nthe remedies provided under Section 163 of EA, 2003, and it would be expected that MSEB would\nexercise it sooner rather than later).\n(b) In all cases where bills have been raised and/or recoveries made which are not in accordance\nwith (a) above, the bills should be withdrawn and/or amounts refunded to the consumers, through\nenergy bills or other means, as may be relevant, by 30th November, 2005, with interest at the same\nrate as payable by consumers to MSEB for delayed payments.\"\n4. Aggrieved against both these orders, the matter was taken up in appeal before the Appellate\nAuthority. The Appellate Authority by the impugned order dated 29th March, 2006 set aside the\norders passed by the Commission and directed that each consumer should approach the forum\ncreated under Section 42(5) of the Act for the individual grievances. 5. Aggrieved against the order\ndated 29.3.2006 passed by the Appellate Authority, the present appeal has been filed under Section\n125 of the Act.\n6. We have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record.Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory ... vs Reliance Energy Ltd. & Ors on 14 August, 2007\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/464821/ 3\n7. Learned counsel for the appellant-Commission has submitted before us that the Commission has\nthe power to give a general direction to its licensees/distribution companies and he also submitted\nthat in exercise of the power under the Act, the Commission was competent to issue the aforesaid\ndirection. As against this, the learned counsel appearing for the respondent-licensees/distribution\ncompanies submitted that the Commission has no power to issue a direction like the one issued in\nthe present case and entertain individual complaints and direct refund of the whole amount by a\nblanket order.\n8. The question before us is : what is the power of the Commission and to what extent the\nCommission can issue directions. Suffice it to say that the Regulatory Commission was constituted\nunder the Electricity Act, 2003. The Act was a new enactment which was promulgated by\nsuperseding the Indian Electricity Act, 1910 and the Electricity Supply Act, 1948. The Statement of\nObjects and Reasons of the Act which have been summarized in the Preamble, reads as under:-\n\"An Act to consolidate the laws relating to generation, transmission, distribution,\ntrading and use of electricity and generally for taking measures conducive to\ndevelopment of electricity industry, promoting competition therein, protecting\ninterest of consumers and supply of electricity to all areas, rationalisation of\nelectricity tariff, ensuring transparent policies regarding subsidies, promotion of\nefficient and environmentally benign policies, constitution of Central Electricity\nAuthority, Regulatory Commissions and establishment of Appellate Tribunal and for\nmatters connected therewith or incidental thereto.\"\n\"Appropriate Commission\" as defined in Section 2(4) of the Act means the \"Central\nRegulatory Commission referred to in sub-section (1) of Section 76 or the State\nRegulatory Commission referred to in Section 82 or the Joint Commission referred to\nin Section 83, as the case may be\". In exercise of its power under Section 82 of the\nAct, the State of Maharashtra constituted the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory\nCommission. The Commission exercises all the powers which are enumerated in the\nAct. Though various provisions were pointed out to us by learned counsel for the\nparties, but Section 82 which is relevant for our purposes reads as under :-\n\"82. Constitution of State Commission-(1) Every State Government shall, within six\nmonths from the appointed date, by notification, constitute for the purposes of this\nAct, a Commission for the State to be known as the (name of the State) Electricity\nRegulatory Commission :\nProvided that the State Electricity Regulatory Commission, established by a State\nGovernment under Section 17 of the Electricity Regulatory Commissions Act, 1998\n(14 of 1998) and the enactments specified in the Schedule, and functioning as such\nimmediately before the appointed date shall be the State Commission for the\npurposes of this Act and the Chairperson, Members, Secretary, and officers and other\nemployees thereof shall continue to hold office on the same terms and conditions on\nwhich they were appointed under those Acts :Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory ... vs Reliance Energy Ltd. & Ors on 14 August, 2007\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/464821/ 4\nProvided further that the Chairperson and other Members of the State Commission,\nappointed, before the commencement of this Act, under the Electricity Regulatory\nCommissions Act, 1998 (14 of 1998) or under the enactments specified in the\nSchedule, may, on the recommendations of the Selection Committee constituted\nunder sub-section (1) of Section 85, be allowed to opt for the terms and conditions\nunder this Act by the concerned State Government. (2) The State Commission shall\nbe a body corporate by the name aforesaid, having perpetual succession and a\ncommon seal, with power to acquire, hold and dispose of property, both movable and\nimmovable, and to contract and shall, by the said name, sue or be sued.\n(3) The head office of the State Commission shall be at such place as the State\nGovernment may, by notification, specify.\n(4) The State Commission shall consist of not more than three Members, including\nthe Chairperson. (5) The Chairperson and Members of the State Commission shall be\nappointed by the State Government on the recommendation of a Selection\nCommittee referred to in Section 85.\"\n9. We are not concerned with the provisions of appointment of Members of the Commission as they\nare dealt with by Sections 84 and 85 of the Act. Section 86 deals with the functions of the\nCommission and is relevant for our purposes. For ready reference, the same is reproduced\nhereunder.\n\"86. Functions of State Commission:- (1) The State Commission shall discharge the\nfollowing functions, namely :-\n(a) determine the tariff for generation, supply, transmission and wheeling of\nelectricity, wholesale, bulk or retail, as the case may be, withing the State:\nProvided that where open access has been permitted to a category of consumers\nunder section 42, the State Commission shall determine only the wheeling charges\nand surcharge thereon, if any, for the said category of consumers;\n(b) regulate electricity purchase and procurement process of distribution of licensees\nincluding the price at which electricity shall be procured from the generating\ncompanies or licensees or from other sources through agreements for purchase of\npower for distribution and supply within the State;\n(c) facilitate intra-State transmission and wheeling of electricity;\n(d) issue licences to persons seeking to act as transmission licensees, distribution\nlicensees and electricity traders with respect to their operations within the State;Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory ... vs Reliance Energy Ltd. & Ors on 14 August, 2007\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/464821/ 5\n(e) promote congeneration and generation of electricity from renewable sources of\nenergy by providing suitable measures for connectivity with the grid and sale of\nelectricity to any person, and also specify, for purchase of electricity from such\nsources, a percentage of the total consumption of electricity in the area of a\ndistribution licensee;\n(f) adjudicate upon the disputes between the licensees and generating companies and\nto refer any dispute for arbitration;\n(g) levy fee for the purposes of the Act;\n(h) specify State Grid Code consistent with the Grid Code specified under clause (h)\nof sub-section (1) of Section 79;\n(i) specify or enforce standards with respect to quality, continuity and reliability of\nservice by licensees;\n(j) fix the trading margin in the intra-State trading of electricity, if considered,\nnecessary;\n(k) discharge such other functions as may be assigned to it under this Act.\n(2) The State Commission shall advise the State Government on all or any of the\nfollowing matters, namely :-\n(i) promotion of competition, efficiency and economy in activities of the electricity\nindustry;\n(ii) promotion of investment in electricity industry;\n(iii)reorganisation and restructuring of electricity industry in the State;\n(iv) matters concerning generation, transmission, distribution and trading of\nelectricity or any other matter referred to the State Commission by that Government;\n(3) The State Commission shall ensure transparency while exercising its powers and\ndischarging its functions. (4) In discharge of its functions, the State Commission shall\nbe guided by the National Electricity Policy, National Electricity Plan and Tariff\nPolicy published under section\n3.\n10. Thus, from the above provision it is clear that the primary purpose of the Commission is to\ndetermine tariff for generation, supply, transmission of electricity etc. and to regulate the electricityMaharashtra Electricity Regulatory ... vs Reliance Energy Ltd. & Ors on 14 August, 2007\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/464821/ 6\npurchase and procurement process of distribution licensees, to facilitate intra-State transmission, to\npromote congeneration and generation of electricity from renewable sources of energy, to adjudicate\nupon the disputes between the licensees and generation companies and to refer any dispute for\narbitration, to levy fee for the purposes of this Act, specify State Grade Code consistent with the Grid\nCode specified under clause (h) of sub-section (1) of Section\n79. Sub-Section (2) of Section 86 also empowers the State Commission to advise the State\nGovernment on any of the matters including promotion of competition, efficiency, matters\nconcerning generation, transmission, distribution and trading of electricity etc. Sub-Section (3)\nprovides that the Commission shall ensure transparency while exercising its powers and discharging\nits functions. Sub-section (4) provides that in discharge of its functions the Commission shall be\nguided by the National Electricity Policy, National Electricity Plan and Tariff Policy published under\nSection 3.\n11. We are not going into other questions as to how licenses were granted to all these utilities, i.e.,\nvarious distribution companies. It is not necessary for us to go into these questions as in the present\ncase, we are primarily concerned to decide the powers of the Commission and to what extent it can\nissue directions and whether the direction given by the Commission in the present case is\nsustainable or not.\n12. It may be noted from a perusal of Section 86(1)(f) of the Act that the State Government has only\npower to adjudicate upon disputes between licensees and generating companies. It follows that the\nCommission cannot adjudicate disputes relating to grievances of individual consumers. The\nadjudicatory function of the Commission is thus limited to the matter prescribed in Section 86(1)(f).\n13. Section 14 of the Act provides for grant of licence; Section 16 provides for conditions of licence;\nSection 61 lays down the tariff regulations and Section 62 provides for determination of tariff. The\nCommission under Section 94 has civil powers also and under Section 96 it has power of entry and\nseizure. Under Section 126 the Commission has the power to investigate and make assessment.\nSection 127 provides for an appeal to the appellate authority. Under Section 128 the Commission\ncan make investigation of certain matters where it is satisfied that the licensee has failed to comply\nwith any of the conditions of licence or failed to comply with any of the provisions of the Act or the\nrules and regulations made thereunder. Sub-Section (6) of Section 128 empowers the Commission\nto take any action against the licensee/generating company. Sub-section (6) reads as under :-\n(6) On receipt of any report under sub-section (1) or sub-section (5), the Appropriate\nCommission may, after giving such opportunity to the licensee or generating\ncompany, as the case may be, to make a representation in connection with the report\nas in the opinion of the Appropriate Commission seems reasonable, by order in\nwriting :-\n(a) require the licensee or the generating company to take such action in respect of\nany matter arising out of the report as the Appropriate Commission may think fit; orMaharashtra Electricity Regulatory ... vs Reliance Energy Ltd. & Ors on 14 August, 2007\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/464821/ 7\n(b) cancel the licence; or\n(c) direct the generating company to cease to carry on the business of generation of\nelectricity.\nSection 142 of the Act provides for punishment for non-compliance of directions issued by the\nCommission and Section 143 empowers the Commission to adjudicate after holding an inquiry in\nsuch manner as may be prescribed by the Government. Section 181 empowers the Commission to\nmake regulations.\n14. A comprehensive reading of all these provisions leaves no manner of doubt that the Commission\nis empowered with all powers right from granting licence and laying down the conditions of licence\nand to frame regulations and to see that the same are properly enforced and also power to enforce\nthe conditions of licence under sub- section (6) of Section 128.\n15. Thus, insofar as the first contention of the learned counsel for the respondents that the\nCommission has no power is concerned, we are of the view that the same is wrong. In this behalf the\nprovisions of The Electricity Act, 2003 are quite clear and categoric and Section 128(6) empowers\nthe Commission to get the conditions of licence enforced. But the question is whether the said power\nunder Section 128(6) has been rightly exercised by the Commission or not. After clearing the first\nhurdle, that the Commission has power to issue directions, we shall now examine whether the\ndirection given by the Commission in the present case is correct or not.\n16. When the Commission received a spate of complaints from consumers against its\nlicensees/distribution companies that they are arbitrarily issuing supplementary/amended bills and\ncharging excess amounts for supply of electricity, it felt persuaded to invoke its general power to\nsupervise the licensees/distribution companies and in that connection issued notice dated 3.8.2004.\nThere can be no manner of doubt that the Commission has full power to pull up any of its licensee or\ndistribution company to see that the rules and regulations laid down by the Commission are\nproperly complied with. After all, it is the duty of the Commission under Sections 45(5), 55(2), 57,\n62, 86, 128, 129, 181 and other provisions of the Act to ensure that the public is not harassed.\n17. In exercise of this general power notice dated 3.8.2004 was issued when mass scale\nsupplementary/amended bills were issued to the consumers. When these consumers approached\nthe Commission, the Commission directed its licensees to immediately review their billing policies\nand bring the same in conformity with the statutory provisions of the Act. The Commission did not\nget an investigation made under Section 128(1) which it could have done, and without that, and\nwithout getting a report under Section 128(5) it passed an order directing refund of the amounts\ncollected by the licensees/distribution companies, which in our opinion was not permissible, since\nsuch a direction could, if at all, be given after getting a report of the investigation agency. The\nCommission could have made an investigation and got a report from the investigation agency and\non that basis directions could have been given. However, that was not done. In these circumstances,\nin our opinion, the view taken by the Appellate Authority in the impugned order to that extent is\ncorrect that the individual consumers should have approached the appropriate forum under SectionMaharashtra Electricity Regulatory ... vs Reliance Energy Ltd. & Ors on 14 August, 2007\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/464821/ 8\n42(5) of the Act.\n18. Thus while we hold that the Commission has power to issue a general direction to licencees that\nthey should abide by conditions of the licence issued by them and charge only as per the tariff fixed\nunder the Act so that the public at large should not be harassed, we are of the opinion that so far as\nthe blanket direction given by the Commission for refunding the entire amount without making a\nproper investigation whether the issue of supplementary/amended bills was really warranted in\nevery case or not is unsustainable. Here the Commission has gone beyond its jurisdiction. After all\nthe distribution/ generating companies have to incur expenses for generation/distribution of power,\nand we cannot at the same time give license to the consumers to commit theft of electricity or to be\nbenefited by improper functioning of the meter to the disadvantage of the distribution/generating\ncompany. Thus, keeping in view the equity of both the parties, we think it will be proper for us to\ndirect that all the licensees/distribution companies in the State of Maharashtra issue a general\npublic notice in two daily newspapers having wide circulation in the State, one English newspaper\nand one in vernacular language. The notice shall state that whoever feels aggrieved by the\nsupplementary/amended bill, he/she can approach the licensee/distribution company for redressal\nof their grievance within a period of three months from the date of publication of the notice. In our\nview, that would meet the ends of justice instead of passing a blanket order as given by the\nCommission for refunding the money charged by the licensees/distribution companies by issuing\nsupplementary/amended bills. The individual consumers may make a grievance before the\nlicensee/distribution company that they have not consumed the electricity for which they are\ncharged or that the meter reading was not proper or that they have been excessively charged for the\npower which they have not actually consumed. Therefore, we direct that all the\nlicensees/distribution companies shall issue a public notice in two daily newspapers having wide\ncirculation in the State of Maharashtra, one in English language and the other in vernacular\nlanguage requiring their respective consumers to make their representations for redressal of their\ngrievances in respect of the supplementary/amended bills. The licensees/distribution companies\nshall decide the individual cases received by them after giving a fair opportunity of hearing to the\nconsumers. The consumers who still feel not satisfied with the order passed by the\nlicensees/distribution companies can approach the appropriate forum constituted under Section\n42(5) of the Act and, if still not satisfied, with the order passed by the appropriate forum to\napproach the Ombudsman under Section 42(6) of the Act. Accordingly, we hold that while the\nCommission had a power to issue general directions to prevent harassment to the public at large by\nits licensees/distribution companies, but a blanket direction to refund the amounts collected by the\nlicensees/distribution companies which has been given by the Commission was not warranted.\n19. Although, the Appellate Authority has set aside the order passed by the Commission and issued a\ndirection that the individual consumers may approach the appropriate orders under Sections 42(5)\nand (6) we are not interfering with that direction, but we direct that before that the\nlicensees/distribution companies shall hear the parties as directed hereinabove and decide whether\nthe supplementary/amended bills issued by them are proper or not.\n20. In view of the above discussion, this appeal stands disposed of with no order as to costs.Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory ... vs Reliance Energy Ltd. & Ors on 14 August, 2007\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/464821/ 9"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Summary"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "- Commission's Power: `Regulatory Oversight`\n  - Category: \u26aa General info\n  - Risk Warning (\u26a0): None\n\n- Amended Bills: `Withdrawal/Refund`\n  - Category: \ud83d\udfe2 Standard financial clauses\n  - Risk Warning (\u26a0): None\n\n- Consumer Grievances: `Individual redressal`\n  - Category: \u26aa General info\n  - Risk Warning (\u26a0): None\n\n- Public Notice: `Licensee response`\n  - Category: \u26aa General info\n  - Risk Warning (\u26a0): None\n\n- Appellate Authority Ruling: `Affirmed partially`\n  - Category: \u26aa General info\n  - Risk Warning (\u26a0): None\n"}]}, "class_name": "SimpleChatStore"}
